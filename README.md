SimulatedEvolution
==================

This project was created by Adrian Blanco and Johan Storby as part of our bachelors thesis in computer science at KTH. The program simulates artificial evolution in bacteria with the help of genetic algorithms. Bacteria which live in the simulation will eat, reproduce, fight flee and continuously evolve to better adapt to their environments which will shape how the ecosystem in the simulation changes over time. The events which unfold in the simulation are saved as MATLAB logs
